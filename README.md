Objectives: To practice event-driven programming using Java-based GUIs. To refresh your basic Java skills.

Description: Develop a Java program that creates a standalone GUI application (not an applet) that simulates an e-store which allows the user to add items (books) to a shopping cart and once all items are included, total all costs (including tax), produces an invoice, and append a transaction log file.


Your program development must include the following steps:
    1. Create a main GUI containing the following components:

        a. An area that allows the user to input data into the application along with the descriptive text that describes each input area.
        b. A total of six buttons as shown below with functionality as described below.
        c. As illustrated below, the various buttons on the interface are only accessible at certain points during a user’s interaction with the e-store.
    2. An input file named “inventory.txt”. This is a comma separated file which contains the data that will be read by the application when the user makes a selection. Each line in this file contains three items; a book id, a quoted string containing the book title and author’s name, and the price for one copy of the book. A sample file is provided for you on WebCourses.

    3. An output file (append only) named “transactions.txt” must be created that uniquely logs each user transaction with the e-store. The unique transaction id will be generated as a permutation of the date/time string when the transaction occurred.

Restrictions:
Your source file shall begin with comments containing the following information:

/* Name: <your name goes here>
*/

Input Specification: The file “inventory.txt” as described above (see example below as well).

Output Specification: Output is to appear in the specified components of the GUI and various message boxes that appear, plus the contents of the “transactions.txt” log file that will be generated.

Deliverables:


Page 1
    (1) Submit a working copy of your source code (all .java files), including your inventory.txt file, via WebCourses no later than 11:59pm Sunday September 15, 2019.
    (2) Include a file that contains screen shots, similar to those illustrated below, that shows your application in action as a user interacts with your e-store to purchase books.
    (3) Include a screen shot of your “transactions.txt” file showing at least the last few transactions (similar to the one shown on the last page of this document).
