    "Objectives: To practice event-driven programming using Java-based GUIs.\n",
    "To refresh your basic Java skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Develop a Java program that creates a standalone GUI\n",
    "application (not an applet) that simulates an e-store which allows the\n",
    "user to add items (books) to a shopping cart and once all items are\n",
    "included, total all costs (including tax), produces an invoice, and\n",
    "append a transaction log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program development must include the following steps: 1. Create a\n",
    "main GUI containing the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. An area that allows the user to input data into the application along with the descriptive text that describes each input area.\n",
    "        b. A total of six buttons as shown below with functionality as described below.\n",
    "        c. As illustrated below, the various buttons on the interface are only accessible at certain points during a user’s interaction with the e-store.\n",
    "    2. An input file named “inventory.txt”. This is a comma separated file which contains the data that will be read by the application when the user makes a selection. Each line in this file contains three items; a book id, a quoted string containing the book title and author’s name, and the price for one copy of the book. A sample file is provided for you on WebCourses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. An output file (append only) named “transactions.txt” must be created that uniquely logs each user transaction with the e-store. The unique transaction id will be generated as a permutation of the date/time string when the transaction occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Restrictions: Your source file shall begin with comments containing the\n",
    "following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "/\\* Name: <your name goes here> \\*/\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Specification: The file “inventory.txt” as described above (see\n",
    "example below as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Specification: Output is to appear in the specified components of\n",
    "the GUI and various message boxes that appear, plus the contents of the\n",
    "“transactions.txt” log file that will be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Page 1 (1) Submit a working copy of your source code (all .java files),\n",
    "including your inventory.txt file, via WebCourses no later than 11:59pm\n",
    "Sunday September 15, 2019. (2) Include a file that contains screen\n",
    "shots, similar to those illustrated below, that shows your application\n",
    "in action as a user interacts with your e-store to purchase books. (3)\n",
    "Include a screen shot of your “transactions.txt” file showing at least\n",
    "the last few transactions (similar to the one shown on the last page of\n",
    "this document)."
